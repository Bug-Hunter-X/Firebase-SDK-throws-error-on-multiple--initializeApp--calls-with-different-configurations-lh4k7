This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase projects where the `initializeApp` function is called multiple times with different configurations, leading to unexpected behavior. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a solution to ensure that `initializeApp` is called only once with the correct configuration.
